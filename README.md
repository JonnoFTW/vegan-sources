Introduction
------------

Reputable sources for not eating animal products backed up by scientific literature.

Health
------
* Plant based iron better than blood based iron https://nutritionfacts.org/2017/06/15/plant-versus-animal-iron/

### Saturated Fat

Works critical of the fact that saturated fats are good for health typically rely on poorly conducted studies, or misleading analysis of studies

* Increases LDL cholesterol increases heart disease risk: https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/38/32/2459/3745109 LDL is mostly found in animal fats (beef, lamb, poultry, pork, butter, cream, milk)
* LDL regardless of size (ie. both LDL and HDL), increases risk of heart disease: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23257303/ 
  >  In contrast, a large body of evidence supports focusing on LDL cholesterol reduction and intensification of statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk.
* Eggs contains LDL. https://nutritionfacts.org/2016/04/28/egg-consumption-and-ldl-cholesterol-size/

### Hormones

* Intake of dairy milk increases estrogen, reduction in testosterone: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19496976/:
  > The present data on men and children indicate that estrogens in milk were absorbed, and gonadotropin secretion was suppressed, followed by a decrease in testosterone secretion. Sexual maturation of prepubertal children could be affected by the ordinary intake of cow milk.
* Soy intake more helpful than harmful: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mnfr.201900751 (harmful only if you have gastric cancer and consume 1-5 cups of miso soup a day)
* Meta-analysis shows no impact of soy on male hormone production: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028209009662
* Soy intake does not affect estrogen production in women: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2691652/pdf/dmp010.pdf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

### B12

* Animals are an inefficient method of producing B12, and livestock are supplemented anyway because of cobalt defficiency in the soil.
* B12 supplementation is a must https://baltimorepostexaminer.com/carnivores-need-vitamin-b12-supplements/2013/10/30

### Diabetes

* <details><summary>Intake of red meat increases risk of type 2 diabetes (n=63,257) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535164/</summary>In conclusion, red meat and poultry intakes were associated with a higher risk of T2D. These associations were mediated completely for poultry and partially for red meat by heme iron intake.</details>

### Cancer Risk

* Animal products contain Neu5gc sugar, which increases inflamation and cancer risk:

   * Red meat increases risk of all-cause mortality https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/179/3/282/103471
   * Red meat increase risk of breast cancer:  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893586/
   

### Safety

* Plant based diets are suitable for anyone:
  * <details><summary>Everyone: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19562864/</summary>It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. </details>
  * <details><summary>Athletes: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566694/</summary>
     Less than 30% of each group had depleted iron stores, however, iron deficiency anemia was not found in any subject. Our findings suggest that a well-planned, health-conscious lacto-ovo-vegetarian and vegan diet, including supplements, can meet the athlete’s requirements of vitamin B12, vitamin D and iron.
    </details>
* Plant based diets reduce mortality:
  * <details><summary>Adventist 2 study (n=96,469) https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1710093</summary> Vegetarian diets are associated with lower all-cause mortality and with some reductions in cause-specific mortality. Results appeared to be more robust in males. These favorable associations should be considered carefully by those offering dietary guidance.</details>
* Very difficult, perhaps impossible to increase muscle mass on a ketogenic diet: https://doi.org/10.1249/JES.0000000000000050
* Plant based low-fat diet decreases energy intake compared to animal based keto diet https://osf.io/preprints/nutrixiv/rdjfb/
* Lifestyle changes can cause regression in heart disease without the use of lipid-lowering drugs: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/014067369091656U (pdf: http://mx1.anneornish.com/wp-content/uploads/can-lifestyle-changes-reverse-coronary-heart-disease.pdf)
    
### Erectile Dysfunction:

### Cholesterol

* <details><summary>Keto diet where protein is from animals increases risk of mortality: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext </summary>Both high and low percentages of carbohydrate diets were associated with increased mortality, with minimal risk observed at 50–55% carbohydrate intake. Low carbohydrate dietary patterns favouring animal-derived protein and fat sources, from sources such as lamb, beef, pork, and chicken, were associated with higher mortality, whereas those that favoured plant-derived protein and fat intake, from sources such as vegetables, nuts, peanut butter, and whole-grain breads, were associated with lower mortality, suggesting that the source of food notably modifies the association between carbohydrate intake and mortality.</details>
